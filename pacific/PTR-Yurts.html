        <h2><b>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</b></h2>
    <dt><b>What is a yurt?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four
            feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed
            with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof
            dome that can be opened.
        </dd>
    <dt><b>How are the yurts furnished?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with
            down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping 
            experience includes electricity and a sink with hot
            and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities
            are located in the lodge.
        </dd>
    <dt><b>What should I bring?</b></dt>
        <dd>
            Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to 
            dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing.
            It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of
            adventure!
